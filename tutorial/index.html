    <h1>Welcome to Glancee!</h1>
    Glancee is automatically creating your profile. It will take just a few seconds! Once ready, visit the Settings
    page if you want to update your bio and add more interests. When you are happy with your
    profile, head over the people list and just start glancing around!
    <div class="note">
        Your name and picture are the same of your Facebook profile and cannot be changed within the app.

    <h1>The People List</h1>
    Here you can browse the list of people near you. To help you identify people related to you, every user has
    two badges: the reputation score and the number of hidden connections. To reveal these connections, tap on a person
    and check out their full profile.
    <div class="note">
        If you don't see anybody near you, try refreshing the people list. Until we reach critical mass, you will
        be able to see also people not-so-near you.

    <h1>The User Profile</h1>
    The Profile highlights mutual friends and affiliations; it also shows how a person's interests relate to yours.<br>
    Start a conversation in the Connect tab: Glancee lets you chat, call with VoIP, and send an email to anyone who
    accepted your connection. Easily reach out to anybody who is near you, without having to share your phone number!
