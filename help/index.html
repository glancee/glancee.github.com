    <h1>The People List</h1>
    When you open Glancee, you see a list of people near you. Normally, these are users in the same neighborhood or at
    the same event, but during the beta you will see other users who could actually be geographically far from you.<br>
    For every user, you see name, pic, bio, and two badges: the reputation score, and the number of hidden connections.
    Sometimes a new person comes by who is very relevant to you: you will receive a notification and the person will be
    highlighted with a special badge.
    <h1>The User Profile</h1>
    When you find someone interesting, tap on their card to see their profile, which lists mutual friends and common
    affiliations. Tap on Interests to see what they like and what interests you share, and tap on Connect to let the
    person know you would like to meet.<br>
    Glancee let's you chat, call with voice-over-ip, and send email to anybody who accepted your connection. This means
    that you can easily reach out to anybody who is near you, without having to share your phone number.
    <h1>Thank you!</h1>
    We hope you will like Glancee. Connect with the other beta testers and send us feedback! Enjoy!
