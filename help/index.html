    <h1>The People List</h1>
    When you open Glancee, you see a list of people near you. Normally, these are users in the same neighborhood or at
    the same event, but during the beta program you will see users who could actually be far from you.<br>
    For every user, you see their name, pic, bio, and two badges: the reputation score, and the number of hidden connections.
    Sometimes a new person comes by who is very relevant to you: you will receive a notification and the person will be
    highlighted with a special badge.

    <h1>The User Profile</h1>
    When you find someone interesting, tap on their card to see their profile, which lists mutual friends and common
    affiliations. Tap on Interests to see what they like and what interests you share, and tap on Connect to start interacting.<br>
    Glancee lets you chat with and make a VoIP call to any Glancee user near you. This means
    that you can easily reach out to anybody who is near you, without having to share your phone number.
