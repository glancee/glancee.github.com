Hi! Tap on a topic to read more about it.
<div id="accordion">
  <h3><a href="#">What is Glancee?</a></h3>
  <div>
    Glancee is a fun and safe way to meet new people with common friends and similar interests. Interests are all things
    important to you: artists you like, products you love, schools where you studied, companies where you worked, and
    more.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">Getting started</a></h3>
  <div>
    We prepared your Glancee profile using your Facebook data as a starting point, but you can always update your bio
    and interests in the Settings menu. When you are happy with your profile, go ahead and discover new people in the
    People tab.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">The <span class="highlight">People</span> tab</a></h3>
  <div>
    Under People you will find a list of nearby users sorted by the number of connections they share with you. Each user
    has two scores:
    <ul>
      <li>The reputation score is a measure of how influential and active the user is on Glancee.</li>
      <li>The similarity score is a count of the friends and interests you share with the user.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">The <span class="highlight">Inbox</span> tab</a></h3>
  <div>
    Under Inbox you will find a list of all the conversations you entertained with other Glancee users sorted from the
    most recent to the oldest. You can use the Inbox to pick up a conversation where you left it, or as a contact list
    to access the profiles of the users you met on Glancee.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">The <span class="highlight">Profile</span> tab</a></h3>
  <div>
    When you open a user's profile, we'll show you all the connections you share. First you will see the friends you
    have in common (if any), and then the user's interests that are similar to yours. Interests are matched using our
    special algorithm which will recommend, for example, skiing if you like snowboarding and Quentin Tarantino if you
    like Pulp Fiction.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">The <span class="highlight">Connect</span> tab</a></h3>
  <div>
    When you find a user you like, tap on the Connect tab to start a conversation. You can send text messages and even
    call with voice-over-ip, without having to share your phone number.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">About the <span class="highlight">Settings</span></a></h3>
  <div>
    Under Settings you can change your bio and your interests, you can invite friends to improve your reputation score,
    and you can lock Glancee for one hour or until 8AM of the next day. We recommend you keep your interests updated to
    find the most interesting people.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">More on interests</a></h3>
  <div>
    When visiting a user profile, tap on an interest to find more information about it. This is great to discover new
    artists and products you may not know about. You can also tap on Discuss to start a conversation about a specific
    interest, or on Add to include the interest in your profile.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">More on recommendations</a></h3>
  <div>
    Sometimes a user comes by who has many connections in common with you. When this happens, you will receive a special
    notification even if you are not using the app and the user will be highlighted in the People tab with a red ribbon.
  </div>
  <h3><a href="#">What devices are supported?</a></h3>
  <div>
    We support all iPhone and iPod Touch running iOS 4.2 or later, and all Android devices running 2.1 or later.
  </div>
</div>
We really hope you like Glancee! If you'd like to send us your feedback, go to <span class="highlight">Settings > Feedback</span>
