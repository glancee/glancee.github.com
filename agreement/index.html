      San Francisco. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
    <h3>Changes to this Agreement</h3>
    <p>Glancee reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate this Agreement, the Service

    <h3>General Legal Provisions</h3>
    <p>This Agreement, your rights and obligations, our rights and obligations, and all actions contemplated by this
      Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of California, including
      California rules concerning conflicts and choice of law, as if this Agreement were a contract wholly entered into
      and wholly performed within the State of California. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
      courts in the County of San Francisco, California, USA, in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of
      our Service. Use of our Service is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of
      these terms and conditions, including, without limitation, this paragraph. In the event of any legal action to
      enforce or interpret the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to recover
      attorneys’ fees.</p>
    <p>No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of this
      Agreement or use of our Service. If any provision in this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
      law, including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, the
      remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect, and the invalid unenforceable provision will be
      deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original
      provision. Our performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained
      in this Agreement is in derogation of our right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements.</p>
    <p>All rights not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved. This Agreement is the entire and final Agreement
      regarding our Service, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether

      and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based
      upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
      documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p>
